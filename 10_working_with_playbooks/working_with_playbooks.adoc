==== Adding controls to loops

==== Migrating from with_X to Loop

With the release of Ansible 2.5 and later, the recommended way to perform loops is the use the new `loop` keyword instead of `with_X` style loops.

Here, I am going to show how to convert `with_` style loops to `loop`.

*with_list*

`with_list` is directly replaced by `loop`

REAL WORLD EXAMPLE:

The problem is: We have a openshift cluster environment running on vlan 10, we need to add more app-nodes to the cluster, but the networking team said that there is no more available IPs on vlan 10, so the networking team had created a vlan 20. There is a Firewall between the vlans, before we start adding new app-nodes we are going to create an Ansible playbook to check the connectivity between the vlans.  

In this example we are going to have a bastion(ansible machine),two sources machines(masters) and one target machine(new_nodes).

. Create the hosts iventory file 
+
[source,yaml]
.[root@bastion v3]# cat hosts.yml 
----
[masters]
host1.ansible-training.lab
host2.ansible-training.lab

[infras]

[new_nodes]
host3.ansible-training.lab

[ocs]

[all:children]
masters
infras
new_nodes
ocs

[source:children]
masters
infras
new_nodes
----

. Create the playbook file called `checkports_send.yaml`.
+
[source,yaml]
.[root@bastion v3]# cat checkports_send.yaml
